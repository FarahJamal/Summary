# Summary.
### hi there ðŸ‘‹
##### today I will show you breifly about  HTML Resources.
###### So let's begin with some fun ðŸŽ†.

## to build a basic website you need some few things:

  * # Wire Frames.
  ## what is wireframe mean?
  
    * ###  A wireframe is a kind of design layout that serves three simple but exact purposes

        *  It presents the information that will be displayed on the page.
        * It gives an outline of the structure and layout of the page.
        * It conveys the overall direction and description of the                           user interface.
    * ###  here is 6 simply steps to do your first wireframe perfectly ðŸ‘Œ.
        * Do your research.
        * Prepare your research for reference.
        * Make sure you have your user flow mapped out.
        * Draft, don't draw. Sketch, don't illustrate.
        * Add some detail and get testing.
        * Start turning your wireframes into prototypes
* # HTML.
## what is the HTML means?

  * ### HTML stands for (HyperText Markup Language). 
    which means defines the structure of your content.
    HTML consists of a series of elements, which you use to enclose, or wrap, different parts of the content to make it appear a certain way, or act a certain way. The enclosing tags can make a word or image hyperlink to somewhere else can italicize words, can make the font bigger or smaller, and so on. 
  * ### Example:
    ``` <p>My cat is very grumpy</p>   ```

    ###### it will shows like ðŸ‘‡

  ``` My cat is very grumpy ```

  * ### another Example:
    about what html looks like: 

      ``` <!DOCTYPE html>
          <html>
            <head>
              <meta charset="utf-8">
              <title>My test page</title>
            </head>
            <body>
              <img src="images/firefox-icon.png" alt="My test image">
            </body>
          </html> ```

* # Semantics.
  * what does Semantics means? 
      * In programming, Semantics refers to the meaning of a piece of code â€” for example "what effect does running that line of JavaScript have?", or "what purpose or role does that HTML element have" (rather than "what does it look like?".)

 * ### Semantics in JavaScript
In JavaScript, consider a function that takes a string parameter, and returns an <li> element with that string as its textContent. Would you need to look at the code to understand what the function did if it was called build('Peach'), or createLiWithContent('Peach')?

* ### Semantics in CSS
In CSS, consider styling a list with li elements representing different types of fruits. Would you know what part of the DOM is being selected with div > ul > li, or .fruits__item?

* ### Semantics in HTML
In HTML, for example, the <h1> element is a semantic element, which gives the text it wraps around the role (or meaning) of "a top level heading on your page."
